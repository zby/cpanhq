Run script/cpanhq_server.pl to test the application.

------------------------------------

To get the tests running do this:

1. "gunzip cpanhq.db.gz"

2. "perl Makefile.PL" - make sure all dependencies are installed.

3. Run "make"

4. perl tmp/gen-twitter-feed.pl

5. Run "make test".

NOTE: the scripts loading the database don't work currently - so I am uploading a loaded db into the repository.
